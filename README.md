# speech_to_text

- I have tried to write a very simple speech to text python code. 
- To use this you have to have some module.Just follow the command
    -- pip3 install SpeechRecognition
    -- sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio
- In this code I have tried to open a web browser if user say some key word like 'let me search on Google'.
- If code find those key word then it will open your default web browser with goole search link. 
- Ok, you are ready to go. 

I will try to improve this code in future. Thank you.
